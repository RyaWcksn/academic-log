1. Explain why incremental development is the most effective approach for developing business software systems. Why is this model less appropriate for real-time systems engineering?

Answer :

Why _Incremental Development_ is effective way approach for dev business application(s) because it's can be low cost since the development is seperated into some step or functions, also it's one of the most simple management model, user doesn't need to wait up until the application completed to get the benefits of the app or get deployed before it's completed fully, risk of failure project is almost zero,

and why this model isn't appeal for real time system engineering because some of the functions might won't be able to integrate one to each others, it's should be open architecture and it's take a long time to produce complete and fix app


2. Consider the reuse-based process model. Explain why it is essential to have two separate requirements engineering activities in the process.

Answer :

it is essential to adapt the system requirements according to the capabilities of the system/components to be reused.
